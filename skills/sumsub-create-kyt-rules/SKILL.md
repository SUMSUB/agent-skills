# Sumsub — KYT Rules, Applicant Scoring & Risk Levels

Configures the full KYT transaction monitoring stack:

- **Rules** — translates user intent into `KytTxnRule` payloads and POSTs them one at a time. Supports creating new rules and modifying existing ones (by posting a new revision). New rules always start in **testMode** (`dryRun: true`) — they appear in `dryScore` but do not affect the live outcome until activated in the dashboard.
- **Tags & applicant scoring** — creates and configures tags (named risk markers) and the assessment that maps tag weights into a composite applicant risk score.
- **Risk levels** — configures the score thresholds that translate a numeric risk score into a human-readable label (e.g. Low / Med / High).

Rules, tags, and risk levels form a single pipeline: a rule fires → applies tags → tags accumulate a weighted score → score maps to a risk level.

## Auth — App Token + secret (sandbox only)

This skill talks to the public Sumsub API and signs each request per
[the authentication reference](https://docs.sumsub.com/reference/authentication).
The full how-it-works writeup lives in the [`sumsub-api-auth`](../sumsub-api-auth/SKILL.md)
skill — read it if you hit `401 Invalid signature`.

> **⚠️ Sandbox tokens only.** Do **not** accept or use a production App Token
> here. If the user offers one, refuse and ask them to generate a sandbox
> pair at <https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/devSpace/appTokens> (toggle
> the workspace to **Sandbox** first, then **Create**). Token + secret are
> shown once — copy both before closing the dialog. The helper script
> enforces this — it rejects tokens that don't start with `sbx:`.

| Var | Example |
|---|---|
| `SUMSUB_APP_TOKEN` | `sbx:...` — sandbox App Token from the dashboard. |
| `SUMSUB_SECRET_KEY` | The paired secret shown once at token creation. |
| `SUMSUB_BASE` | Optional. Defaults to `https://api.sumsub.com`. |

If the user has already supplied credentials in conversation, reuse them;
otherwise ask once before running. Never echo the secret back.

## Tenant Entitlements

KYT rules require the `KYT` entitlement at minimum. Additional per-type requirements apply:

| Rule `types` value | Required entitlement |
|---|---|
| `finance` | `KYT` |
| `travelRule` | `TRAVEL_RULE` |
| `kyc` | `KYT` (or `TM_INDIVIDUAL_APPLICANT_SCORING`, `TM_COMPANY_APPLICANT_SCORING`, `KYT_ANTI_FRAUD`, `DEVICE_INTELLIGENCE`) |
| `userPlatformEvent` | `KYT_ANTI_FRAUD` + `KYT` |
| `scheduledEvent` | `TM_SCHEDULED_EVENTS` + `KYT` |

Before creating any rules, run `bash scripts/check_permissions.sh` from the
[`sumsub-check-permissions`](../sumsub-check-permissions/SKILL.md) skill directory
and verify `KYT` (and any type-specific permission) is present in the `allowed` array.

**If `KYT` is not in `allowed` — stop immediately.** Do not build or POST any rules.
Tell the user the entitlement is missing and that they need to contact their CSM or Sumsub support to get it enabled.

## Procedure

0. **Fetch tenant entitlements.** Run `sumsub-check-permissions` and store the `allowed` array.
   Verify `KYT` is present; abort with an explanation if missing.

1. **Determine mode — create or modify.**

   - **Modify mode:** the user provides a rule `name` (immutable slug, e.g. `fin-ben-pep-ter-list-abo-thr-WoGD`) or enough context to identify one. Run `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_rules.sh`, find the rule by `name` or `title`, and store the full current document. Show the user the existing `conditionEl`, `score`, `action`, and `types`, then collect only the fields they want to change. Skip to step 2a.
   - **Create mode:** the user describes a new rule. Run `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_rules.sh` and check for a title collision — the server creates a duplicate on every POST with no deduplication. If a rule with a matching title already exists, offer to skip creation and modify the existing one instead.

2. **Translate user intent to compact specs.** For each rule the user wants to create, collect:
   - `title` (≤128 chars, required)
   - `types` — one or more transaction types (see table below)
   - A plain-English description of the condition (used to generate `conditionEl` in step 3)
   - `score` (integer, default 0), `action` (`score` | `onHold` | `awaitUser` | `reject`)
   - Optional: `desc`, `tags`, `bundleName`, `priority`, `stopOnMatch`, `sourceKeys`

2a. **Ensure client lists exist** — if any rule will reference `clientLists.<name>` in its `conditionEl`,
    verify each list exists before generating or validating expressions:
    ```bash
    bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_client_list.sh <listName>
    ```
    - HTTP 200 → list exists; proceed.
    - HTTP 404 → list does not exist; create it:
      ```bash
      bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/create_kyt_client_list.sh <listName>
      ```
    The POST is idempotent — it succeeds even if the list was created in the meantime.
    **Do not proceed to validation or rule creation** until every referenced client list is confirmed.

3. **Generate `conditionEl`.** For each rule that needs a condition:
   - Construct the SumScript boolean expression using the type definitions in
     [`references/kyt-rule-schema.md`](references/kyt-rule-schema.md).
   - **Do not guess field paths.** Only use fields confirmed in the schema — verify the path
     from root to leaf before writing the expression.
   - For default-currency amount checks use `data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency` (normalized amount),
     not `data.info.amount` (source-currency amount) — unless the user explicitly asks for
     source-currency filtering.
   - Scheduled rules (`types: ["scheduledEvent"]`) do NOT use `conditionEl` for their trigger —
     use `noEventTrigger` instead (see [references/kyt-rule-schema.md](references/kyt-rule-schema.md)).
   - For multi-branch scoring (different score per sub-condition), use `addScoreIf` inside
     `conditionEl` and set the payload-level `score: 0`, `action: "score"` (see Scoring section).

3a. **Validation is built into POST** — the server validates `conditionEl` syntax during the create call (step 6). No separate pre-flight step is needed. If validation fails the server returns HTTP 400 with an error message describing the problem — fix the expression and re-POST.

4. **Build payload.** Assemble the JSON for each rule following these constraints:

   **Create mode:**
   - **Required fields only:** `title`, `types` (min 1 value).
   - For `eval` rules: include `conditionEl`, `score`, and `action` when relevant.
   - **Never send** `id` or `name` — the server assigns both.

   **Modify mode (new revision):**
   - Include `"name": "<existing-slug>"` — the immutable slug from the existing rule.
   - Include `"id": null` — an explicit null. This signals the server to create a new revision rather than a new rule. Do **not** use `"id": ""` (empty string) — Jackson will reject it as an invalid ObjectId and return HTTP 400.
   - Carry over all unchanged fields from the existing rule document. Only change the fields the user asked to modify.
   - `title` and `types` remain required.

   **Both modes — always apply:**
   - **Never send** server-assigned or audit fields: `clientId`, `actual`, `revision`,
     timestamps (`createdAt`, `modifiedAt`, `archivedAt`), author fields.
   - **Never send** `scope` or `bgCheckTargets` — license-control fields managed by the server.
   - **Create mode:** never send `dryRun` or `disabled`; the server initialises them to `true` and `false`.
   - **Modify mode:** carry over `dryRun` and `disabled` from the existing rule document — the server uses the sent values to preserve the rule's current activation and test-mode state across the revision.
   - **Omit empty optional containers:** `sourceKeys: []`, `caseAction: {}`,
     `applicantChange: {}`, `applicantActions: {"actions": {}}`,
     `varDefinitions: {"definitions": []}`, `varValues: {"values": {}}`.
   - Do not mix `scheduledEvent` with other transaction types.

5. **Show each payload to the user and ask for explicit confirmation** before any POST.

6. **POST each rule** via `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/post_kyt_rule.sh < payload.json`.
   Rules are created one at a time. Check the exit code:
   - **Exit 0** → HTTP 200; the response body is the created `KytTxnRuleView`. Proceed to step 7.
   - **Exit 1** → HTTP 4xx/5xx; the response body contains the error message. Surface it verbatim,
     fix the expression, and re-POST.

   **Retry cap:** allow at most **10 POST attempts per rule**. If the 10th attempt still fails,
   mark that rule as **failed**, record the last error message, and move on to the next rule —
   do **not** abort the entire batch. Report all failed rules in step 9.

7. **GET each created rule back** via `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_rule.sh {id}`.
   Compare `conditionEl` and key fields to what was sent. Report any discrepancy.

8. **Build the dashboard link** for each rule:
   ```
   https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/kyt/rulesManager/rulesList/{name}?clientId={clientId}&xSNSEnv=sbx
   ```
   `name` and `clientId` come from the POST response body. Render as a clickable markdown link.

9. **Report** — for each rule, lead with its human-readable title:
   - **Title** and auto-generated `name` (the short immutable slug)
   - **Status:** testMode — must be activated in the dashboard to go live
   - `types`, `action`, `score`
   - Dashboard link as a clickable markdown link
   - Rule `id` on its own final line

   For rules that exhausted all 10 attempts, report them in a **Failed rules** section with the
   title and the last HTTP 400 error message.

   Surface 4xx errors verbatim.

> **⚠️ testMode default.** Every new rule starts with `dryRun: true`. It evaluates against
> transactions and its result appears in `dryScore`, but does not affect the real score or
> action. To make a rule live, open it in the dashboard and set it to "Active".

## Compact Spec Format

Express each rule as a JSON object before generating the full payload:

```jsonc
{
  "title": "Hold large outgoing transfers",         // required, ≤128 chars
  "desc": "Holds outgoing transactions over 50 000 in default currency",
  "types": ["finance"],                             // required
  "condition": "outgoing AND amount > 50 000 default currency",  // natural language → conditionEl
  "score": 100,                                     // 0 if using addScoreIf
  "action": "onHold",                              // score | onHold | awaitUser | reject
  "tags": ["HighAmount"],                           // optional; auto-created if new
  "bundleName": "AML Compliance",                   // optional group
  "priority": 10,                                   // optional; higher = evaluated first
  "stopOnMatch": false,                             // optional
  "sourceKeys": ["payment-gateway-1"]               // optional top-level filter
}
```

## Transaction Types

| Type | When to use | `conditionEl` required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `finance` | Payment transfers, deposits, withdrawals | Yes | Most common type |
| `travelRule` | Travel-rule transactions | Yes | Requires `TRAVEL_RULE` entitlement |
| `kyc` | KYC/verification session events | Yes | |
| `userPlatformEvent` | Login, password reset, 2FA events | Yes | Requires `KYT_ANTI_FRAUD` |
| `scheduledEvent` | Periodic applicant re-checks | No (use `noEventTrigger`) | Must be alone in `types` |

Types may be combined in one rule except `scheduledEvent` which must be the only type.

## Rule Actions

| Action | Priority | Effect |
|---|:---:|---|
| `score` | 0 | Adds score only (default) |
| `onHold` | 5 | Holds the transaction for review |
| `awaitUser` | 7 | Awaits user action before proceeding |
| `reject` | 10 | Rejects the transaction outright |

Across all matched rules, the **strongest action wins** and scores **accumulate**.

## Scoring & `conditionEl`

**Simple rule (single threshold, one score):** Put the score in `score` and keep `conditionEl` as a pure boolean.

```json
{
  "title": "Hold high outgoing finance",
  "types": ["finance"],
  "conditionEl": "data.info.direction == 'out' AND data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 50000",
  "score": 100,
  "action": "onHold"
}
```

**Multi-branch scoring (different scores per sub-condition):** Use `addScoreIf` inside `conditionEl`.
Set payload `score: 0` and `action: "score"` — otherwise the payload score is double-counted.

- **`EOR` (eager OR):** every branch is evaluated, all matching branches accumulate score. Use for independent flags.
- **`OR` (short-circuit):** stops at the first matching branch. Use for mutually exclusive tiers (strictest first).

```
addScoreIf(data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 100000, 50) EOR
addScoreIf(applicant.country IN clientLists.sanctioned_countries, 100) EOR
addScoreIf("pep" IN applicant.riskLabels.aml, 75)
```

## Common `conditionEl` Patterns

```
# Finance: outgoing transfer over threshold
data.info.direction == 'out' AND data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 50000

# Finance: applicant in a client list
applicant.country IN clientLists.high_risk_countries

# Finance: incoming from specific payment type
data.info.direction == 'in' AND data.info.type == 'transfer'

# Finance: crypto transaction
data.info.currencyType == 'crypto'

# KYC: applicant review rejected
applicant.review.decision == 'rejected'

# Travel Rule: counterparty VASP not found
txn.travelRuleInfo.status == 'counterpartyVaspNotFound'

# Aggregation: applicant sent > 3 transactions in last 24 hours
txns.finance.byApplicant.out.lastHours(24).count() > 3

# Aggregation: total outgoing amount in last 30 days
txns.finance.byApplicant.out.lastDays(30).sum(it.data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency) > 100000
```

For the full type system and all available fields, see [`references/kyt-rule-schema.md`](references/kyt-rule-schema.md).

## Client Lists

Client lists are named sets of values (countries, currencies, peer IDs, etc.) referenced in `conditionEl` as `clientLists.<listName>`. A list must exist before a rule that references it can be validated or created.

### Checking and creating a list

```bash
# Check if a list exists
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_client_list.sh high_risk_countries

# Create a list (idempotent)
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/create_kyt_client_list.sh high_risk_countries
```

The POST creates an empty list if it doesn't exist and returns the list document either way.

### Required permissions

| Operation | Permission |
|---|---|
| GET (read) | `seeClientLists` |
| POST (create) | `manageClientLists` |

If the GET returns 403, `seeClientLists` is missing. If the POST returns 403, `manageClientLists` is missing. In both cases, tell the user the missing permission and stop.

### Usage in `conditionEl`

Reference a list by its exact name after the `clientLists.` prefix:

```
# Country in a named list
applicant.country IN clientLists.high_risk_countries

# Peer wallet not in an allowlist
NOT (txn.counterparty.wallet IN clientLists.approved_wallets)

# Combined
applicant.country IN clientLists.sanctioned_countries AND data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 1000
```

List contents are managed separately in the Sumsub dashboard (KYT → Client Lists) — the API endpoints only create an empty list; adding values is a dashboard-only operation.

## Tags

Tags link rule matches to applicant-level risk assessment:

- Add `tags: ["TagName"]` to a rule — the tag name auto-creates in KYT settings if new.
- When the rule matches, each tag accumulates the rule's score for the applicant.
- The `applicantAssessment` post-scoring runner aggregates tag scores into the applicant risk profile.

## Scheduled Rules (`scheduledEvent`)

Scheduled rules fire without an incoming transaction. They find applicants based on trigger criteria
and generate synthetic events. See [`references/kyt-rule-schema.md`](references/kyt-rule-schema.md)
for the full `noEventTrigger` structure.

Key constraints:
- `types` must be exactly `["scheduledEvent"]` — cannot be combined with other types.
- Must include `applicantChange` or `applicantActions` (at least one).
- `conditionEl` is optional (use for secondary filtering, not as the primary trigger).
- `noEventTrigger.type` is either `byLevelName` (approved applicants at a level, N days after review)
  or `byCustomExpression` (free-form applicant filter expression).

Minimal scheduled rule:
```json
{
  "title": "Annual KYC refresh",
  "types": ["scheduledEvent"],
  "noEventTrigger": {
    "type": "byLevelName",
    "levelParams": {
      "levelName": "basic-kyc-level",
      "days": 365
    }
  },
  "applicantChange": {
    "type": "applicantLevel",
    "applicantLevel": {
      "levelName": "re-verification-level"
    }
  }
}
```

## Case Creation on Match

To automatically create a compliance case when a rule matches, add `caseAction`:

```json
{
  "caseAction": {
    "createCase": true,
    "groupByType": "byApplicant",
    "blueprintId": "<case-blueprint-id>",
    "priority": "high",
    "deadlineHours": 24
  }
}
```

`groupByType`: `byRule` (one case per rule) or `byApplicant` (one case per applicant, transactions grouped).
`blueprintId` is optional — omit to use the default case template.

## Modifying an Existing Rule

To update a rule, POST a new revision to the same endpoint used for creation. The server replaces the current revision atomically and increments `revision`.

### Identify the rule

The user must supply the rule's `name` (immutable slug) or enough context to identify it by title. List all rules and find the match:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_rules.sh | python3 -c "
import json, sys
items = json.load(sys.stdin).get('list', {}).get('items', [])
for r in items:
    if r.get('name') == 'fin-ben-pep-ter-list-abo-thr-WoGD':
        print(json.dumps(r, indent=2))
"
```

Or search by title substring:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_kyt_rules.sh | python3 -c "
import json, sys
items = json.load(sys.stdin).get('list', {}).get('items', [])
for r in items:
    if 'PEP' in r.get('title', '').upper():
        print(json.dumps(r, indent=2))
"
```

Show the matching rule's current `conditionEl`, `score`, `action`, and `types` to the user before proceeding.

### Payload shape

Take the existing rule document, apply only the user's requested changes, then:
- Set `"id": null` — explicit null (signals new revision, not new rule). Never use `""` — it fails Jackson ObjectId deserialization with HTTP 400.
- Keep `"name": "<slug>"` — the existing immutable slug.
- Strip server-managed fields: `clientId`, `actual`, `revision`, `scope`, `bgCheckTargets`, timestamps, author fields.
- **Keep** `dryRun` and `disabled` from the existing document — they preserve the rule's current activation and test-mode state across the revision.

```json
{
  "id": null,
  "name": "fin-ben-pep-ter-list-abo-thr-WoGD",
  "title": "Finance — Beneficiary in PEP and terror list above threshold",
  "types": ["finance"],
  "conditionEl": "beneficiary.fullName IN clientLists.pep_and_terror AND data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 5000",
  "score": 100,
  "action": "onHold",
  "dryRun": true,
  "disabled": false
}
```

### Validate before posting

If `conditionEl` changed, the POST validates it automatically. If the server returns HTTP 400, fix the expression and re-POST (same 10-attempt cap as create mode applies).

### After posting

- The response contains the new `id` (the latest revision gets a new id), old `name`, `revision` number, and all rule fields.
- GET the rule back by the new `id` to verify.
- The dashboard link uses the old `name`:
  ```
  https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/kyt/rulesManager/rulesList/{name}?clientId={clientId}&xSNSEnv=sbx
  ```
- Report the new `revision` number alongside the title and updated fields.

## Applicant Risk Scoring

Applicant risk scoring calculates a composite risk score for each applicant based on the transaction monitoring rules that matched them. The score is built from three layers configured independently:

```
Rules (produce tags on match)
  └─ Tags (each carries a score weight)
       └─ Assessment (maps tags → weighted score)
            └─ Risk Levels (score thresholds → Low / Med / High label)
```

### How it works

1. **Rules fire** — when a TM rule matches a transaction, it applies its `tags` to the applicant.
2. **Tags accumulate** — each tag carries a `scoreWeight`. Multiple rule matches sum tag scores.
3. **Assessment aggregates** — the assessment config controls which tags count toward the total score (`includeInTotalScore`), their relative weights (`scoreWeight`), and optional hierarchy (`items`).
4. **Risk level assigned** — the total score is compared against `riskLevelThresholds` to produce a human-readable risk label (e.g. Low / Med / High).

For companies, `companyBeneficiarySettings` in the assessment applies role-based weights (UBO, director, shareholder…) so the applicant's score accounts for the risk of their associated parties.

### Configuring applicant scoring — step by step

**Step 1 — Create/update tags**

```bash
echo '{"tag": {"name": "HighValue", "styleClass": "red", "color": "#FF000080", "scorable": true, "scoreWeight": 1.0}}' \
  | bash scripts/post_kyt_tag.sh
```

Read back all tags to confirm:
```bash
bash scripts/get_kyt_tags.sh
```

**Step 2 — Configure assessment**

Map tags to weighted scores. `id` is a client-assigned stable identifier for the entry.

```json
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "id": "high-value-score",
      "tag": "HighValue",
      "includeInTotalScore": true,
      "scoreWeight": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "companyBeneficiarySettings": [
    { "beneficiaryType": "ubo",      "weight": 1.0 },
    { "beneficiaryType": "director", "weight": 0.5 }
  ]
}
```

Valid `beneficiaryType` values: `shareholder`, `representative`, `director`, `ubo`, `companyOfficer`, `secretary`, `founder`, `investor`, `legalAdvisor`, `authorizedSignatory`, `trustee`, `trustBeneficiary`, `trustSettlor`, `trustProtector`, `payer`.

```bash
# Read current
bash scripts/get_kyt_applicant_assessment.sh

# Apply new config
echo '<payload>' | bash scripts/patch_kyt_applicant_assessment.sh
```

**Step 3 — Configure risk level thresholds**

```bash
# Read current
bash scripts/get_kyt_risk_level_settings.sh

# Apply new thresholds (min 2 required)
echo '{"riskLevelThresholds": [
  {"label": "Low",  "rangeFrom": 0,   "styleClass": "green"},
  {"label": "High", "rangeFrom": 75,  "styleClass": "red"}
]}' | bash scripts/patch_kyt_risk_level_settings.sh
```

### Tags in rules

Add `tags` to a rule's payload to connect rule matches to the assessment:

```json
{
  "title": "Flag high-value transfers",
  "types": ["finance"],
  "conditionEl": "data.info.amountInDefaultCurrency > 10000",
  "score": 50,
  "action": "score",
  "tags": ["HighValue"]
}
```

When this rule matches, the `HighValue` tag is applied to the applicant and its weight contributes to their risk score.
